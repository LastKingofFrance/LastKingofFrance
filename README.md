- 👋 Hi, I’m @LastKingofFrance
- 👀 I’m interested in History, Football, Chess, and then Data here. Probably math first before data.
-  Think about it the only reason we have data and data science is because some people in modern-day Iraq wanted to record the produce they had farmed.
-  How is that at all interesting?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a better person. But I should probably say something like Python or R or how to become a holistic actuary. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something that will impact people. 
- 📫 How to reach me: probably via email at allannyariki@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him 
- ⚡ Fun fact: In 2012 Kendrick made one of the top 10 albums in rap history good kid, m.A.A.d city which he lost to Macklemore's Random Access Memories an inferior album.
- Three years later he would make To Pimp a Butterfly arguably one of the top 5 best albums not only in rap but music history and then won a deserved Grammy one year later.
- This is a long fun fact but the moral of the story is if  things don't work out go back to the studio but it will take time.
